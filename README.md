# AdventOfCode2018

My solutions for AdventOfCode 2018 - Csharp + Linq

The date/time is shifted, because i am starting later (on 6:00 AM i am going to 
work so I can't solve it in that time). I write solving time of each solution in
each commit message. One day - one commit message.

The solutions are slightly cleaned to be more readable for other users. 

I am adding the solutions just for others, to learn other solutions. I like 
C# and integrated Linq query language so i am using those technologies everywhere.

If someone likes the solution or have recommendation to shorten some lines - feel
free to open an ticket, we can discuss that. I like to learn something new ! I 
write using olny two fingers so shorter solution to write = faster result :-)
